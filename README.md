## 🚀 Overview

**DevLens** is a multi-platform AI developer tool suite designed to completely eliminate code review bottlenecks and onboarding friction. By leveraging the blistering speed of **Gemini 2.5 Flash**, DevLens scans code snippets or entire GitHub repositories to provide actionable insights, security audits, and performance reviews in seconds.

Whether you prefer a **No-Install Web Application**, integrated **IDE Slash Commands**, or a **VS Code Extension**, DevLens meets you where you work.

---

## 🎯 The Problem

Modern software development teams face significant friction points:
- **😰 Pre-PR Anxiety**: Developers are unsure if their code meets standards before submitting.
- **⏰ Slow Reviews**: Waiting hours or days for a senior engineer to review a Pull Request.
- **📚 Onboarding Hell**: Spending weeks trying to understand a legacy or complex codebase.
- **🔍 Missing Edge Cases**: Shipping security vulnerabilities or performance bottlenecks due to human oversight.

**The result?** Slower shipping cycles, increased technical debt, and developer burnout.

---

## 💡 The Solution

DevLens acts as an automated, infinitely scalable Senior Engineer. It offers **6 core analysis modes** directly from a beautiful Next.js web interface:

1. 🔍 **Code Review**: Get senior-level PR reviews with risk scores, bug detection, and actionable feedback.
2. 🔒 **Security Audit**: OWASP Top 10 vulnerability scanning with specific fixes and severity ratings.
3. 📖 **Code Explanation**: Understand complex algorithms with plain English explanations.
4. 🧪 **Test Coverage**: Identify untested code and generate ready-to-use Jest/Pytest/JUnit templates.
5. ⚡ **Performance Check**: Find bottlenecks via Big O analysis and optimization suggestions.
6. 🔧 **Refactoring**: Detect code smells and apply SOLID design pattern improvements.

### 📦 Full Repository Scanning
DevLens isn't limited to snippets. Paste **ANY public GitHub repository URL**, and DevLens will automatically fetch the codebase tree, read the files, and generate a comprehensive "Repo Bible" to help you onboard in minutes.

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack & Architecture

We built DevLens for maximum speed and scalability:

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 (App Router), React, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend API**: Next.js Serverless Route Handlers
- **AI Engine**: Google Gemini 2.5 Flash (Optimized for low-latency reasoning)
- **Integrations**: GitHub REST API (for full repository tree parsing)
- **Deployment**: Vercel Edge Network
- **UI/UX**: Custom glassmorphism design system, React Markdown for rich formatting

---

## 🎬 How It Works (Web App)

1. **Visit the Live Site**: Head over to our Vercel deployment.
2. **Choose Your Mode**: Select either "Code Snippet" or "GitHub Repository".
3. **Paste & Analyze**: Paste your code or a GitHub URL (e.g., `https://github.com/vercel/next.js`).
4. **Get Insights**: Within seconds, Gemini 2.5 Flash processes the context and streams back a rich, markdown-formatted report.
5. **No Limits**: We've removed all daily caps—enjoy **Unlimited Analysis**.

## ⚡ Option 2: Slash Commands (AI Editors & IDEs)

Beyond the Web App, DevLens provides **12 powerful slash commands** that work natively inside your favorite AI editors (IBM Bob, Cursor, Copilot, Cody, Windsurf). Just type and go—no copy-pasting required!

### 🎯 Core Slash Commands

- 1️⃣ `/review-pr`: Instant Senior-Level Code Review with risk scoring and potential bugs.
- 2️⃣ `/explain-repo`: Generates a complete "Repo Bible" summarizing architecture and data flow.
- 3️⃣ `/security-audit`: OWASP Top 10 security vulnerability detection.
- 4️⃣ `/test-coverage`: Identifies untested critical paths and generates test templates.
- 5️⃣ `/performance-check`: Finds N+1 query problems, memory leaks, and O(n²) bottlenecks.
- 6️⃣ `/suggest-refactor`: Intelligent code smell detection and SOLID principle refactoring.
- 7️⃣ `/explain-code`: Translates complex logic into simple, real-world analogies.
- 8️⃣ `/generate-commit`: Generates meaningful, conventional commit messages for your staged changes.

### 🚀 Quick IDE Setup

To enable slash commands in your project, simply run our one-line setup:

```bash
cd your-project
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Anshsurana123/dev-lens-IBM-BOB/main/setup-slash-commands.sh | bash
```

**That's it!** Now you can type `/review-pr` or `/explain-repo` directly in your IDE's AI chat window.

### 📝 Manual IDE Setup (If Preferred)

#### 🤖 IBM Bob IDE (Native)
```bash
cd your-project
git clone https://github.com/Anshsurana123/dev-lens-IBM-BOB.git .devlens
cp -r .devlens/.bob .
# Use: /review-pr, /explain-repo, etc.
```

#### 🎨 Cursor / Windsurf
```bash
cd your-project
git clone https://github.com/Anshsurana123/dev-lens-IBM-BOB.git .devlens
cp .devlens/.cursorrules .
cp -r .devlens/prompts .devlens/
# Use: /review-pr, /explain-repo, etc.
```

#### 🐙 GitHub Copilot / Cody
```bash
cd your-project
git clone https://github.com/Anshsurana123/dev-lens-IBM-BOB.git .devlens
cp -r .devlens/.vscode .
cp -r .devlens/prompts .devlens/
# Use: /review-pr or /devlens-review-pr
```

#### 📦 VS Code Extension
DevLens also ships as a native VS Code Extension for one-click analysis.
```bash
code --install-extension devlens.devlens
# Use Command Palette: "DevLens: Review PR"
```

## 🏆 IBM Bob Hackathon 2026 Impact

DevLens was purpose-built for the **IBM Bob Hackathon 2026** under the theme:
> *"Turn idea into impact faster"*

### How we deliver impact:
1. **Faster Shipping**: Instant code reviews eliminate human waiting time.
2. **Faster Onboarding**: "Repo Bible" generation makes new developers productive in minutes.
3. **Faster Debugging**: Proactive security and performance audits catch bugs before they merge.

DevLens literally turns the idea of "better code" into the impact of "shipped code"—faster.
